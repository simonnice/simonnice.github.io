## What is robots.txt and how have you configured it for your site?  
<br>

Robots.txt is a simple tool for making sure that search engine bots only index the parts of your website that you allow them to. This means you can restrict access to specific folders that you may not want indexed, and you can also allow or disallow the bots access to the entire site. This is by no means a security feature, and malicious bots may (and will) ignore this file. I have configured my file to only allow Google full access to crawl my site. I have no particular data I want to keep from Google, and allowing it to index my site will help to make it appear on google searches.

## What is humans.txt and how have you configured it for your site?  
<br>

Humans.txt is a tool developed as kind of an answer to the robots.txt idea. The idea is simple: Provide some way to give readers of your site the possibility to get information on the *humans* behind the site without the creator needing to openly provide this information in the website design (for example in the footer). By accessing humans.txt, people can access the information you have put there, which usually consists of the name of the creator of the site, his or her contact information, etc. It is entirely up to the site creator to decide which information goes there.
For my humans.txt, I kept it simple. It only consists of some basic information regarding me and how to contact me, a thank you-section and some site details.
