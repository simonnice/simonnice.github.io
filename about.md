## Hello there!  
<br>

You have arrived at the website of Simon Bååth, aspiring web programmer in training! 
I'm usually quite modest, but I got to say that this website is looking better and better, if
a bit simplistic. But sometimes simple is good!  
<br>
### Well, what about me?  
<br>
Originally hailing from the deep and unforgiving forests of Dalsland, I've grown accustomed to taking walks in the woods. Unrelated, but still interesting (I guess, since you're still reading) is the fact that I also love all things tech. A testament to this fact is that I'm not only studying web programming at 120% capacity, I'm also working part time at Kjell & Company! You got to *love* technical stuff if you do that!  
<br>
### Would you like to know more?  
<br>
I applaud you if you got that reference. I'm actually a **huge** Sci-fi buff, with a deep love for movies and novels on the subject. Book wise, I'm stuck in the universe of *The Expanse*, a sci-fi series written by James S. A. Corey. Movie wise, I love Star Wars (who doesn't, right?), Star Trek and old classics like Starship Troopers. And before you say anything: yes, you can like both Star Trek and Star Wars **equally**.  
<br>
### Looking forward  
<br>
I aim to get a good job doing web programming, preferably something focused on the *back-end* part, but I'm open to all kinds of work in the sector! This is an exciting field that is constantly evolving, and that is the part I like about it the most!  
<br>
See you on the web!
